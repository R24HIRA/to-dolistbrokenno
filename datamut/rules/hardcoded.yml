  # Database connection strings
  - func: database_connection
    mutation: "hardcoded database connection"
    default_severity: HIGH
    notes: |
      Hardcoded database connection strings pose security risks and reduce flexibility.
      Consider using environment variables or configuration files.

  # File paths
  - func: file_path
    mutation: "hardcoded file path"
    default_severity: MEDIUM
